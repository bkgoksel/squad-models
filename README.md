# Work plan:

- [x] Prepare harness for tokenization, batch building and evaluation
- [x] Make a basic LSTM->Dense->Spans&no-answer outputting model to get the whole training/testing process running
- [x] Think about data cleanup, tokenization and all the other shenanigans of working with SQuAD
- [ ] Make GPU compatible
- [ ] Debug simple architecture
- [ ] Implement BiDAF on top
- [ ] Integrate ELMo vectors
- [ ] GAN setup for negative generation
